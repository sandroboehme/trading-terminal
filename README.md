This is a POC for loading the candles with CCXT from Binance and providing them to an Angular 11 client via the Python FastAPI library.
The price will be updated using the Cryptocompare Websocket API directly in the client.

Just follow the instructions in `server/README.md` and `client/README.md` to install and start the server and client.
